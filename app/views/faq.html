          <div class="question">Why is this needed in Monterey County?</div>
          
          <div class="answer">
          <p>Transportation is a quality of life issue for people of all ages. Older adults become especially vulnerable as they lose mobility and independence as the gradually reduce their driving to address personal limitations.</p>

          <p>On average; Women outlive their ability to drive by 10 years, men by 6 years.</p>

          <p>Older people who continue to drive face the 2nd highest fatal crash rate of all age groups. Drivers ages 80 and older have higher crash death rates per mile driven then other age groups except teen drivers.</p>

          <p>The number of people aged 60 years and older in Monterey County is projected to increase by more than 60% by the year 2030. In real numbers this population is forecasted to increase from 69,850 in 2010 to 112,768 in 2030. Over 80% of the senior population in Monterey County lives on the Monterey Peninsula or in the City of Salinas.</p>

          <div class="qa" id="cost-service">
          <div class="question">What is the cost to use the service?</div>
          
          <div class="answer">
          <p>Yes, cost will be dependent on fundraising through community partners. In general:
            <ul>
              <li>Users must be members of ITNMontereyCounty. Annual membership is $60 for an individual and $80 for a family.</li>
              <li>The average ride will cost less than the cost of an equivalent taxi cab ride.</li>
              <li>The Independent Transportation Network America (ITNA) model includes scholarships to assist low-income riders.</li>
              <li>Discounts are applied for shared rides and scheduling in advance.</li>

          <div class="qa" id="cost-low">
          <div class="question">How are the costs of rides kept low?</div>
          
          <div class="answer">
          <p>Volunteer drivers keep costs down by providing the majority of the trips. An innovative credit program allows drivers to earn credits towards future trips for every trip they provide. Credits can be banked for the driver's future use or donated to members in the area or other affiliate areas. </p>
          <p>There are several innovative ideas that encourage business and groups to provide scholarships for their clients. I.e.: "Ride and Shop" and "Healthy Miles" In other affiliate areas donations from local community groups and businesses cover half the cost to operate the program. <a ui-sref="become-member">See become a member</a></p>

          <div class="question">How do riders pay for rides?</div>
          
          <div class="answer">
          <p>Members place funds in an account for their future use. The cost of each ride is debited from the member's account. No cash is exchanged between the driver and the rider.<a ui-sref="become-member">See become a member</a></p>

          <div class="question">What is the Independent Transportation Network®?</div>
          
          <div class="answer">
          <p>The Independent Transportation Network® (ITN), is the first and only national nonprofit transportation system for America's aging population.</p>

          <p>Our ITN model creates an efficient and financially sustainable solution to the transportation needs of seniors and visually challenged people. As ITN Members, older people maintain their independence and their dignity. </p>
          
          <p>They:
            <ul>
              <li>continue to be part of the economic and social health of their communities</li>
              <li>feel empowered</li>
              <li>stay connected to family, friends and community</li>

          <div class="qa" id="service-for">
          <div class="question">What do ITN<em>MontereyCounty</em> members use the service for?</div>
          <div class="answer">
            <p>ITN<em>MontereyCounty</em> understands that older people want to do much more than go to the doctor or the grocery store. For this reason, the service may be used for any purpose, without restriction, in an ITN<em>MontereyCounty</em> service area. For example, ITN<em>MontereyCounty</em> members often use the service to attend senior college, to get their hair done, to shop at the mall, and to go out on dates.</p>

          <div class="qa" id="transporation-ss">
          <div class="question">What is Transportation Social Security™?</div>
          <div class="answer">
            <p>Independent Transportation Network ® (ITN) volunteer drivers store transportation credits for their volunteer efforts. These credits may be used to plan for their own future transit needs or they may use these credits to help pay for rides for members of their family or for low income seniors through the Road Scholarship Program™. ITN transportation credits are honored at any ITN in the country.</p>

          <div class="answer">

          <div class="question">What is CarTrade™?</div>
          <div class="answer">
            <p>Automobiles depreciate in value and when older people have vehicles they can no longer drive, the ITN CarTrade™ program helps them convert this depreciating capital asset into a fund to pay for their rides. In a way, CarTrade™ allows people to continue to benefit from their automobiles. Participation in CarTrade™ is a benefit of ITN membership, and there is no charge.</p>

          <div class="qa" id="ride-services">
          <div class="question">What are Ride Services?</div>
          <div class="answer">
            <p>Community organizations such as churches, assisted living facilities, and health care providers may contract with ITN to provide transportation services for their members. Once a month, ITN sends a statement to the organization to pay for the rides that the members take. This is a way for community organizations to supplement the transportation services they already provide. Community organizations that participate in Ride Services also help to support the ITN affiliate organization.</p>

          <div class="qa" id="personal-transportation-account">
          <div class="question">What is a Personal Transportation Account™?</div>
          <div class="answer">
            <p>The Personal Transportation Account™ is one of the core business innovations of the ITN system because it allows an ITN member to store transportation assets in various forms - either as a credit or as cash. Credits may be earned as a volunteer driver, by trading a car for rides through the CarTrade™ program, as a birthday credit, or as a referral credit. Cash may come from pre-payment, gift certificates, co-payments from participating merchants and healthcare providers, or from Ride Services accounts. ITN is a cashless system. Seniors who ride receive a statement once a month detailing the rides they have taken. Volunteer drivers also have personal transportation accounts to store their credits and receive statements detailing their accumulated balances.</p>

          <div class="qa" id="family-membership-campaign">
          <div class="question">What is the Family Membership Campaign?</div>
          <div class="answer">
            <p>This is an annual outreach event to the families of those who need or use ITN service. ITN asks the adult children or families of those who use the service to support the program by becoming members.</p>

          </div>

          <div class="qa" id="public-funds">
          <div class="question">Why does ITN avoid using public funds for operating expenses?</div>
          <div class="answer">
            <p>ITN affiliate communities may use up to 50 percent public funds in the first 7 years or service. Because ITN does not want to compete with public transportation for scarce tax payer dollars, we seek to supplement public transportation by working directly with seniors, their families, and their communities to access private resources.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="qa" id="what-is-affiliate">

            <p>ITN<em>America</em>​'s affiliates provide rides with door-to-door, arm-through-arm service to thousands of seniors nationwide.
